## üé¨ The Journey: Alex's Transformation

**Meet Alex**: A Farcaster creator who's built cool stuff but feels scattered across the ecosystem. They've launched a meme coin, have a Hypersub, collaborate with other creators, and post great content - but nobody can see the full picture of their Web3 empire.

## üöÄ Act I: The "Holy Shit" Moment (30 seconds)

### Landing on Fartree
Alex clicks a Fartree link from a cast. The landing page immediately makes them feel seen:

**What Alex sees:**
- Clean, retro-tech aesthetic that screams "this is for builders"
- Headline: "The Linktree for Farcaster" 
- Subtext: "Auto-generates your Web3 profile from your FID"
- Example profiles of creators they recognize
- One massive purple button: "Sign in with Farcaster"

**Alex's internal monologue:**
*"Wait... it auto-generates? So I don't have to manually add every link? And it knows about my token launch and Hypersub? This might actually solve my problem."*

**The Hook**: Alex realizes this isn't another manual link tool - it's AI for their Web3 identity.

### The SIWN Flow
