# Fartree: Product Concept Document
*"The Linktree for Farcaster - auto-generates your Web3 profile from your FID, connecting all your mini-apps, tokens, and collabs in one shareable link."*

---

## üéØ The Problem

**Farcaster creators are scattered across the ecosystem with no unified identity hub.**

- Creators use 10+ different mini-apps (Hypersub, token launchers, galleries, DAOs)
- No easy way to showcase everything they've built in one place
- Manual link management is tedious and gets outdated quickly
- Discovery of creator's full activity requires hunting across multiple platforms
- Web2 solutions (Linktree, Carrd) don't understand Web3/Farcaster context

## üí° The Solution

**Fartree**: An auto-generating profile builder that uses your Farcaster ID (FID) as the backbone to create a comprehensive, always-updated hub of your Web3 activity.

### Core Magic
1. **Connect once** ‚Üí Auto-scans your Farcaster activity
2. **Instant profile** ‚Üí Pre-populated with your tokens, hypersubs, collaborations
3. **Always fresh** ‚Üí Updates automatically as you use new mini-apps
4. **One shareable link** ‚Üí `fartree.xyz/yourname`
